# History of US Appropriations in JSON format

This repository contains (in progress) a manually compiled, machine-readable history of federal appropriations in the United States.  The intent of this project is to present a reasonable format for such a history that might be generated directly from federal government data sources and provided as an API for developers and researchers to use as needed.

## Sources

Much of the data contained here comes from just a few sources (links below are examples of the type of page from that site used):

* [Library of Congress' THOMAS "Status of Appropriations Legislation" tables](http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/app08.html)
* [Congress.gov Appropriations Status charts](http://beta.congress.gov/legislation/appropriations/fy2015)
* [House Clerk vote results pages](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll432.xml)

## Want to help?

I can use all the help I can get.  If you'd like to help tweak the JSON schema or manually input data from the sources listed above, please contact me.  You can message me via [my account profile here on GitHub](https://github.com/nihonjinrxs).
