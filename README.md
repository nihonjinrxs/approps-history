# History of US Appropriations in JSON format

This repository contains (in progress) a manually compiled, machine-readable history of federal appropriations in the United States.  The intent of this project is to present a reasonable format for such a history that might be generated directly from federal government data sources and provided as an API for developers and researchers to use as needed.
